# DSA 360 – Coding Journey

This repository documents my complete progress through **GeeksforGeeks – DSA 360**, a structured Data Structures & Algorithms program.

Every question is stored in its own folder with:

- `question.md` → full problem statement
- `solution.cpp` → my C++ solution

The goal is to maintain a clean and trackable coding journey while building strong DSA fundamentals.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each week has its own directory, and each question inside that week has:

```yaml
Qxx/
[question.md]
[solution.cpp]


Example:

Week-01-Mathematics/
Q01/
[question.md]
[solution.cpp]
Q02/
[question.md]
[solution.cpp]

```
